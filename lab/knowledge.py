- Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known astronomical object to support life.
- Approximately 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with the Pacific Ocean being the largest.
- The Earth's atmosphere is composed mainly of nitrogen (78%) and oxygen (21%), with traces of other gases.
- Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, leading to the cycle of day and night.
- The planet has one natural satellite, the Moon, which influences tides and stabilizes Earth's axial tilt.
- Earth's tectonic plates are constantly shifting, leading to geological activities like earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.
- The highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, standing at 8,848 meters (29,029 feet) above sea level.
- The deepest part of the ocean is the Mariana Trench, reaching depths of over 11,000 meters (36,000 feet).
