## What are Agents?

**Agents** are AI programs that execute tasks autonomously. They solve problems by running tools, accessing knowledge and memory to improve responses. Unlike traditional programs that follow a predefined execution path, agents dynamically adapt their approach based on context, knowledge and tool results.

Instead of a rigid binary definition, let’s think of Agents in terms of agency and autonomy.

- **Level 0**: Agents with no tools (basic inference tasks).
- **Level 1**: Agents with tools for autonomous task execution.
- **Level 2**: Agents with knowledge, combining memory and reasoning.
- **Level 3**: Teams of specialized agents collaborating on complex workflows.

If this is your first time building agents, [follow this guide](https://docs.agno.com/agents) and then dive into more advanced concepts.

## Example: Research Agent

Let’s create a research agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo, scrape the top links using Newspaper4k and write a research report for us. Ideally we’ll use specialized tools (like Exa) but let’s start with the free tools first.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from pathlib import Path
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.exa import ExaTools

today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[ExaTools(start_published_date=today, type="keyword")],
    description=dedent("""\

Use the `Agent.run()` function to run the agent and return the response as a `RunResponse` object or a stream of `RunResponse` objects.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunResponse = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponse] = agent.run("Tell me a 5 second short story about a lion", stream=True)

# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True)
```
Set stream=True to return a stream of RunResponse objects.
## RunResponse

The `Agent.run()` function returns either a `RunResponse` object or an `Iterator[RunResponse]` when `stream=True`. It has the following attributes:

### RunResponse Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `content` | `Any` | `None` | Content of the response. |
| `content_type` | `str` | `"str"` | Specifies the data type of the content. |
| `context` | `List[MessageContext]` | `None` | The context added to the response for RAG. |
| `event` | `str` | `RunEvent.run_response.value` | Event type of the response. |
| `event_data` | `Dict[str, Any]` | `None` | Data associated with the event. |
| `messages` | `List[Message]` | `None` | A list of messages included in the response. |
| `metrics` | `Dict[str, Any]` | `None` | Usage metrics of the run. |
| `model` | `str` | `None` | The model used in the run. |
| `run_id` | `str` | `None` | Run Id. |
| `agent_id` | `str` | `None` | Agent Id for the run. |
| `session_id` | `str` | `None` | Session Id for the run. |
| `tools` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | `None` | List of tools provided to the model. |
| `images` | `List[Image]` | `None` | List of images the model produced. |
| `videos` | `List[Video]` | `None` | List of videos the model produced. |
| `audio` | `List[Audio]` | `None` | List of audio snippets the model produced. |
| `response_audio` | `ModelResponseAudio` | `None` | The model’s raw response in audio. |
| `created_at` | `int` | \- | Unix timestamp of the response creation. |
| `extra_data` | `RunResponseExtraData` | `None` | Extra data containing optional fields like `references`, `add_messages`, `history`, `reasoning_steps`, and `reasoning_messages`. |

One of our favorite features is using Agents to generate structured data (i.e. a pydantic model). Use this feature to extract features, classify data, produce fake data etc. The best part is that they work with function calls, knowledge bases and all other features.
​
Example

Let’s create an Movie Agent to write a MovieScript for us.

```python
from typing import List
from rich.pretty import pprint
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

class MovieScript(BaseModel):
    setting: str = Field(..., description="Provide a nice setting for a blockbuster movie.")
    ending: str = Field(..., description="Ending of the movie. If not available, provide a happy ending.")
    genre: str = Field(
        ..., description="Genre of the movie. If not available, select action, thriller or romantic comedy."
    )
    name: str = Field(..., description="Give a name to this movie")
    characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Name of characters for this movie.")
    storyline: str = Field(..., description="3 sentence storyline for the movie. Make it exciting!")

# Agent that uses JSON mode
json_mode_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    response_model=MovieScript,
)
# Agent that uses structured outputs
structured_output_agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You write movie scripts.",
    response_model=MovieScript,
)

# Get the response in a variable
# json_mode_response: RunResponse = json_mode_agent.run("New York")
# pprint(json_mode_response.content)
# structured_output_response: RunResponse = structured_output_agent.run("New York")
# pprint(structured_output_response.content)

json_mode_agent.print_response("New York")
structured_output_agent.print_response("New York")
```
